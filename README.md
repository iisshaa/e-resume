# E-resume

This E-resume is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The resume is mostly implemented using HTML,CSS and almost all its tags and functions have been utilized. Using HTML the images, bullets, paragraphs, hyperlinks, bold texts were added and using the inline and external CSS the margins, size, opacity, font-size and color were added. With slight use of JavaScript the hovering effect was implemented on the name heading ‘ISHA ROSHAN’ using the mouseenter and mouseleave function. It includes all my details like education, work experience, achievements, position of responsibility, interest and hobbies. In the project section the link to website and GitHub have been added using HTML which the user can access by clicking on the heading of each project. Similarly in achievements section the links to all my certificates have added which can be accessed by clicking on the headings. The attachment icon is used for the viewer to understand that there is an attachment for the document.
